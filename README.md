-What is Arijeng? 
Arijeng is a food ordering app, this is the customer app that will allow our township or Kasi culture customers to order their favourite meals like Kota, Chips/fries, Pap and steak or chicken and many more delicious food that our restaurant offers.

The Arijeng restaurant is located in my township called Diepsloot.

I am currently updating my app with all relevant latest android technologies were am using the likes of jetpack compose for building my ui and a lot of kotlin flows and Coroutines for my data related stuff inside the view models and also am structuring my project to use multiple feature moduralization structure and Mvvm approach. 

Here's the app link:
